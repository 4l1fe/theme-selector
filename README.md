### Demo screen cast

 The `alacritty-theme` command is the shell alias `select_theme.py --alacritty-themes-path=~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes --alacritty-config-path=~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml --posh-config-path=~/.config/kvdm.omp.toml'`

## Motivation

Once, I got really fed up with manually writing a theme file in Alacritty's config. I always ended up forgetting why I chose a specific theme in the first place. As more themes keep coming out, itâ€™s hard to remember all of them over time. So, I thought it would be a good idea to code an interactive theme selector that lets me quickly pick a nice theme and keep my thoughts persistent about them.
